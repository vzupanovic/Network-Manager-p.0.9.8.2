<p>
    NetworkManager 0.9 is a new major version of NetworkManager that breaks
    both API and ABI compared to previous versions.  These changes are
    intended to make communication with NetworkManager much simpler, especially
    for network control and configuration programs.  Thankfully, most changes
    are not difficult to implement, and the advantages of the simpler
    architecture of NetworkManager 0.9 greatly outweight the effort of
    updating client programs.

<a name="idp5648400"></a>Architecture and D-Bus API Changes in 0.9</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      This section details the architectural and D-Bus API changes in
      NetworkManager 0.9.
    </p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idp5822552"></a>Elimination of the User Settings Service</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      Previously there were two "settings services", or D-Bus services that
      provided and saved network configuration information.  NetworkManager
      owned the "system" settings service, and one user-level applet owned the
      "user" settings service.  Now, the "user" settings service has been
      eliminated, so clients only have to track one D-Bus service to read and
      update network configuration.  The functionality of the old user settings
      service has been replaced with a "permissions" key on each connection
      object to preserve the ability to restrict which users can use the
      connection, and with a "secret agent" D-Bus API for user-session-level
      secure storage of network secrets and passwords.
    </p>
<p>
      Elimination of the user settings service provides the following advantages
      for clients of NetworkManager:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">Simpler discovery of network configuration and change tracking</li>
<li class="listitem">Simpler storage of user-level network secrets by control applets</li>
<li class="listitem">Correct operation of fast-user switching and multi-seat configurations</li>
<li class="listitem">More granular network connection permissions for system administrators</li>
<li class="listitem">Connections are now system-wide by default (unless restricted by the user or system administrator)</li>
<li class="listitem">Easier deployment of user-specific connections (ie, VPNs)</li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    </p>
<p>
      With this change, D-Bus methods that previously took a "service name"
      argument (like
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.ActivateConnection</code>) and
      objects with service name properties (like ActiveConnection objects) no
      longer have those arguments or properties.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="strong"><strong>Action:</strong></span> if you develop a network control
      applet that talks to NetworkManager and used to provide a user settings
      service, you can eliminate that code and rely on NetworkManager for all
      storage of network configuration.  Your applet should now implement the
      Secret Agent D-Bus API (see below) to store user-specific secrets, and
      add legacy user-specific configuration to NetworkManager when run.  More
      information about both these changes follows.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idp5357608"></a>User Secret Agents</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      Even with the elimination of the user settings service, in some cases it
      is still desirable to store secrets in the user's session and not in
      system-wide storage (and thus available to all users).  To allow this
      functionality the concept of agents has been introduced.  Using the new
      <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.AgentManager" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.AgentManager</code></a>
      D-Bus interface provided by NetworkManager, user applications can register
      themselves as "secret agents", ie programs capable of saving and providing
      secrets to NetworkManager.  The agent should export the
      <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.SecretAgent" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.SecretAgent</code></a>
      D-Bus interface, but should NOT claim a bus name on the system or session
      bus.  Instead, NetworkManager talks to the agent directly over the D-Bus
      connection which the agent used to register itself.
    </p>
<p>
      Each agent must send a unique identifier to NetworkManager when it
      registers.  This identifier must follow certain rules (see the NM D-Bus
      API documentation for more details) but looks essentially the same as
      a D-Bus service name.  Only one agent using a given identifier may be
      registered at the same time.  The agent is automatically unregistered
      if it disconnects from D-Bus or exits.
    </p>
<p>
      When NetworkManager requires secrets during the attempt to connect to a
      network, and no secrets are available from the internal settings service,
      NetworkManager queries each registered agent for secrets.  Agents that
      are in "active" user sessions (as determined by ConsoleKit) are preferred
      over inactive ones.  Only agents belonging to users who have permission
      to view and modify the connection are queried.  For more information on
      connection permissions, see below.
    </p>
      When secrets are requested, the agent is also sent a set of flags that
      modify the behavior of the request.  By default, the agent should never
      attempt to query the user for secrets, but should simply return any
      available saved secrets.  Other flags allow the agent to explicitly
      request new secrets from the user.
    <p>
      <span class="strong"><strong>Action:</strong></span> the parts of a previous user
      settings service that handled secrets may be easily repurposed as the bulk
      of the implementation of a secret agent.  The agent is sent all available
      connection settings, and from those should be able to retrieve or save
      any saved user secrets, or to request new secrets from the user.
    </p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idp5812760"></a>Settings Service Interface Changes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      With the elimination of the user settings service, the old
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings</code> and
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSystemSettings</code> D-Bus
      service names are no longer used.  Instead NetworkManager provides the
      settings service using its own D-Bus service name,
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager</code>.  The object path of
      the settings service has also changed to
      <code class="literal">/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, the D-Bus interface of the settings service has changed
      to <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings</code></a> from
      the old interface name of
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings</code>, and the old
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.System</code>
      interface has been merged into the new
      <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings</code></a> interface
      as the split no longer made sense. This includes the
      <code class="literal">SaveHostname</code> method and the <code class="literal">Hostname</code>
      and <code class="literal">CanModify</code> properties.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="strong"><strong>Action:</strong></span> change the service name and
      object path that your application uses to request system network settings
      to <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager</code> and
      <code class="literal">/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings</code> respectively,
      and update the D-Bus interface that codes uses to talk to the settings
      service to <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings</code></a>.
      Listen for hostname changes using the new interface name as well.

</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idp4658248"></a>Connection Object Interface Changes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      Consistent with the interface changes to the Settings object, the
      Connection object's D-Bus interface has changed to
      <a class="ulink" href="spec.html#org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection" target="_top">
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection</code></a>
      from the previous 
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.Connection</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, the
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection.Updated</code>
      signal of the Connection object no longer includes the updated settings
      data argument, as that might allow users who are not authorized to
      view the connection details to do so.  Instead, when a client receives the
      Updated signal, it should requery the Connection's settings with the
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection.GetSettings</code>
      method.  If the client receives an error as a result of this method call,
      it should assume the connection has been deleted.
    </p>
<p>
      <span class="strong"><strong>Action:</strong></span> where code manipulates
      Connection objects, update the D-Bus interface that code uses to be
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection</code>.
      Additionally, code that listens for the
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection.Updated</code>
      signal should no longer expect the new settings data as an argument, but
      instead should request the new settings data using the
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings.Connection.GetSettings</code>
      method.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idp3147688"></a>Permissions Methods Consolidation</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      Previously there were two D-Bus method calls to retrieve the list of
      operations that a user client could perform, and two signals notifying
      callers that they should recheck permissions.  Those two calls were:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.System.GetPermissions</code>
          which returned a bitfield of operations the caller was allowed to
          perform related to modify system network settings and the machine
          hostname
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.GetPermissions</code> which
          returned a dictionary mapping permission names to result strings like
          "yes", "auth", or "no", relating to network control permissions like
          the ability to enable or disable WiFi.
        </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      These two calls have been consolidated into an enhanced
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.GetPermissions</code> call that
      uses the same arguments, but includes all permissions, including those which
      the settings service used to handle.
    </p>
<p>
      With this change, the bitfield items from
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.System.GetPermissions</code>
      are now string-based permissions.  The mapping is as follows:

<a name="idp1529928"></a>Consolidated Modem Devices</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
      Many new mobile broadband devices support multiple access families, like
      Qualcomm Gobi cards (CDMA/EVDO and GSM/UMTS), or multi-mode EVDO/LTE
      or UMTS/LTE modems like the Pantech UML290.  The previous hard split
      between CDMA/EVDO and GSM/UMTS device classes was not flexible enough to
      deal with these new multi-mode devices.  Thus the previously separate
      CDMA and GSM device classes have been combined into a single Modem
      device class, which exposes both hardware "ModemCapabilities" and
      runtime "CurrentCapabilities" which represent generic access technology
      families like CDMA/EVDO, GSM/UMTS, and LTE which the device supports.
      ModemCapabilities indicate all the access technology families which the
      modem is capable of supporting, while CurrentCapabilities indicate the
      immediate access technology families the device supports without reloading
      the firmware and thus restarting the device.
    </p>
<p>
      Along with this change, the
      <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device.Serial</code>

      <span class="strong"><strong>Action:</strong></span> user interface code which
      handles entry of connection secrets should be updated to read and set
      secret flags.  For example, code that creates new VPN connections may want
      to set the "agent-owned" flag to ensure that the user's VPN password is
      not available to all users.  EAP-TLS and VPN interface code might add a
      checkbox that toggles the "not saved" bit to indicate that the
      password/PIN code should be requested from a hardware token each time it
      is required.

<p>
      A few methods and signals of the <code class="literal">org.freedesktop.NetworkManager</code>
      interface deprecated in version 0.7 have been removed.  All the
      replacement methods and signals have existed since version 0.7 and so are
      not new to this version of NetworkManager, but some older programs may
      be using removed items.  The following table lists the removed items and
      their replacements:
