.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmcli
is a command\(hyline tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting on its status.
It is not meant as a full replacement for \fInm\(hyapplet\fP or other similar clients
but as a complementary utility to those programs.
The main usage for \fInmcli\fP is on servers, headless machines or for power users
who prefer the command line.
.P
Typical applications include:
.IP \(em 4
Initscripts: ifup/ifdown can utilize NetworkManager via \fInmcli\fP instead of
having to manage connections itself and possibly interfere with NetworkManager.
.IP \(em 4
Servers, headless machines: No GUI is available; then \fInmcli\fP can be used
to activate/deactivate connections.  However, if a connection requires a secret
in order to activate and if that secret is not stored at the system level,
\fInmcli\fP will not be able to activate it; it is currently unable to supply
the secrets to NetworkManager.
.IP \(em 4
User sessions: \fInmcli\fP can be used to activate/deactivate connections from
the command line, but a client with a secret agent (like \fInm\(hyapplet\fP) is needed
for supplying secrets not stored at the system level. Keyring dialogs and
password prompts may appear if this happens.
.SS \fIOPTIONS\fP
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terse
Output is terse.  This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script)
processing.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Output is pretty. This causes \fInmcli\fP to produce easily readable outputs
for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode tabular | multiline
Switch between \fItabular\fP and \fImultiline\fP output.
If omitted, default is \fItabular\fP for most commands. For the commands
producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single
line, default is \fImultiline\fP. Currenly, they are:
.br
.nf
  'nmcli con list id|uuid <name>'
  'nmcli dev list'
.fi
\fItabular\fP   \(en Output is a table where each line describes a single entry.
Columns define particular properties of the entry.
.br
\fImultiline\fP \(en Each entry comprises multiple lines, each property on its own
line. The values are prefixed with the property name.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fields <field1,field2,...> | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed.
Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by
providing an invalid value to the \fI\-\-fields\fP option.
.br
\fIall\fP is used to print all valid field values of the command.
\fIcommon\fP is used to print common field values of the command.
If omitted, default is \fIcommon\fP.
The option is mandatory when \fI\-\-terse\fP is used.  In this case, generic
values \fIall\fP and \fIcommon\fP cannot be used.  (This is to maintain
compatibility when new fields are added in the future).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-escape yes | no
Whether to escape ':' and '\\' characters in terse tabular mode.  The escape
character is '\\'.
If omitted, default is \fIyes\fP.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show \fInmcli\fP version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.

.br
Connect to a Wi\(hyFi network specified by SSID or BSSID. The command creates a new
connection and then activates it on a device. This is a command\(hyline counterpart
of clicking an SSID in a GUI client. The command always creates a new connection
and thus it is mainly useful for connecting to new Wi\(hyFi networks. If a connection
for the network already exists, it's better to connect through it using
\fInmcli con up id <name>\fP. Note that only open, WEP and WPA\(hyPSK networks are
supported at the moment. It is also supposed that IP configuration is obtained via
DHCP.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fInmcli\fP's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.
.IP "LC_ALL" 13
If set to a non\(hyempty string value, it overrides the values of all the other
internationalization variables.
.IP "LC_MESSAGES" 13
Determines the locale to be used for internationalized messages.
.IP "LANG" 13
Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset
or null.

.RE
Internationalization notes:
.br
Be aware that \fInmcli\fP is localized and that's why the output depends on
your environment. This is important to realize especially when you parse the
output.
.br
Call \fInmcli\fP as \fBLC_ALL=C nmcli\fP to be sure the locale is
set to "C" while executing in a script.

\fBLC_ALL\fP, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP, \fBLANG\fP variables specify the LC_MESSAGES
locale category (in that order), which determines the language that \fInmcli\fP
uses for messages.  The "C" locale is used if none of these variables are set,
and this locale uses English messages.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fInmcli\fP exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is
returned if an error occurs.
.IP "0" 4
Success \(en indicates the operation succeeded
.IP "1" 4
Unknown or unspecified error
.IP "2" 4
Invalid user input, wrong \fInmcli\fP invocation
.IP "3" 4
Timeout expired (see commands with \fI\-\-timeout\fP option)
.IP "4" 4
Connection activation failed
.IP "5" 4
Connection deactivation failed
.IP "6" 4
Disconnecting device failed
.IP "7" 4
Connection deletion failed
.IP "8" 4
NetworkManager is not running
.IP "9" 4
\fInmcli\fP and \fINetworkManager\fP versions mismatch

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-t \-f RUNNING nm\fP\fP"
.IP
tells you whether NetworkManager is running or not.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-t \-f STATE nm\fP\fP"
.IP
shows the overall status of NetworkManager.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli nm wifi off\fP\fP"
.IP
switches Wi\(hyFi off.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-p con list\fP\fP"
.IP
lists all connections NetworkManager has.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-f name,autoconnect con list\fP\fP"
.IP
lists all connections' names and their autoconnect settings.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli con list id \(dq\&My wired connection\(dq\&\fP\fP"
.IP
lists all details of the connection with "My wired connection" name.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-p con up id \(dq\&My wired connection\(dq\& iface eth0\fP\fP"
.IP
activates the connection with name "My wired connection" on interface eth0.
The \-p option makes nmcli show progress of the activation.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli con up uuid 6b028a27\-6dc9\-4411\-9886\-e9ad1dd43761 ap 00:3A:98:7C:42:D3\fP\fP"
.IP
connects the Wi\(hyFi connection with UUID 6b028a27\-6dc9\-4411\-9886\-e9ad1dd43761 to the AP
with BSSID 00:3A:98:7C:42:D3.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli dev status\fP\fP"
.IP
shows the status for all devices.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli dev disconnect iface em2\fP\fP"
.IP
disconnects a connection on interface em2 and marks the device as unavailable for
auto\(hyconnecting. That's why no connection will automatically be activated on the
device until the device's "autoconnect" is set to TRUE or user manually activates
a connection.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli \-f GENERAL,WIFI\-PROPERTIES dev list iface wlan0\fP\fP"
.IP
lists details for wlan0 interface; only GENERAL and WIFI\-PROPERTIES sections will be shown.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli dev wifi\fP\fP"
.IP
lists available Wi\(hyFi access points known to NetworkManager.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli dev wifi con \(dq\&Cafe Hotspot 1\(dq\& password caffeine name \(dq\&My cafe\(dq\&\fP\fP"
.IP
creates a new connection named "My cafe" and then connects it to "Cafe Hotspot 1" SSID
using "caffeine" password. This is mainly useful when connecting to "Cafe Hotspot 1" for
the first time. Next time, it is better to use 'nmcli con up id "My cafe"' so that the
existing connection profile can be used and no additional is created.
